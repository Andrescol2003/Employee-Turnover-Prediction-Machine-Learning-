# Employee Turnover Prediction – Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether an employee will **stay or leave a company** using **Machine Learning models**.  
The objective is to support **HR decision-making** by identifying high-risk employees early and providing insights into the key factors that influence turnover.
